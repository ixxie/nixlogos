## Proposal for refreshed Nix Ecosystem Logos

This is an early draft.

**Goals** for the redesign:

- to refresh to logo, moving it towards modern design intuitions 
- keep clear continuity of visual identity
- loosen the feel of the brand a tad to make it more playful.

**Changes** with respect to the current logo:
 
- Used a new font: Advent Pro, has 7 weights, SIL Open Font License v1.10
- Renewed color palatte to modernize it; freshened the blues and turned the text to a dark gray to reduce contrast a bit.
- Adjusted its scale relative to the text for visual balance.

There are two versions:

- v1 with the above changes
- v2 with additionally a tilt in the snowflake

I prefer v2 but I know a lot of the functionalist hard core of NixOS loves symmetry and may hate it, so I made two versions. I believe its good to loosen the image a little in order to encourage a more diverse userbase.
