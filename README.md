## Proposal for refreshed Nix Ecosystem Logos

This is an early draft.

**Goals** for the redesign:

	- to refresh to logo, moving it towards modern design intuitions 
	- keep clear continuity of visual identity
	- loosen the feel of the brand a tad to make it more playful.

**Changes** with respect to the current logo:
 
	- Used a new font: Advent Pro, has 7 weights, SIL Open Font License v1.10
	- Renewed color palatte to modernize it; freshened the blues and turned the text to a dark gray to reduce contrast a bit.
	- Tilted the snowflake subtly to break the symmetry and loosen the logo up a bit; also adjusted its scale relative to the text for visual balance.
